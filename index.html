            <p>Hello everyone. It has been an insane last few months and the feedback we have been getting has fueled our fires! We are proud to say that all of our content is officially complete and we are going to be meeting our official release date of 6/22/18 where we will be showcasing the game at TooManyGames in the greater Philadelphia area!This current release is a special one, as this will finally give access to the airship and the entire world will be open <span class="fold">(except the climactic ending through the Battle of the Blighted Lands and the invasion of the Validian Empire!) We are showcasing the game with all of its' sidequests (Except the final hidden dungeon) and we guarantee you at least 40 to 50 hours of gameplay... but let me be perfectly honest with you. At this point the jig is up, there is likely over 100 hours of gameplay here for the hardcore completionist. At this point the game's hand holding will stop, as we have been playing these games for over twenty years, we are proud to present some seriously challenging content in this new release... and we would love to hear your battle stories! (Who will be the first to defeat Pale Night or reclaim the Dwarven City from the Drow overlords?!)Good luck to you, we look forward to presenting you with the conclusion on 6/22! And remember, where the horizon ends, the journey begins!</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We hope everyone’s having an excellent weekend! For the development team at Horizon’s End, the work never stops! It has been an epic journey bringing our original Dungeons & Dragons homebrew to life. It’s kind of surreal to think that, after all these years, in less than a month our story will finally be completed and ready for release. Our supporters’ feedback has really kicked us into overdrive and we are planning to release Chapter IV (it. is. massive.) in its entirety on June 4th. In the meantime, we are polishing <span class="fold">up the first half of this enormous tale to be released on 5/28. We hope you haven’t been sitting on the edge of your seat for too long! This is the first part of the story where there will be no set party leader and you may choose every member of your team. So get ready for even more customization!</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>PAX East was absolutely amazing! Interest in The Great Gaias far exceeded our expectations! It was wonderful to see how many people share our love of the turn-based rpg genre, and support what we are doing with The Great Gaias in our quest to see this style of game reborn! Now that the core development team has returned from an epic weekend in Boston, we are looking forward to the end of June when The Great Gaias is set to be released! Early Access on Steam is currently undergoing review, and those <span class="fold">who purchase early access will receive 50% off as a thank you for supporting our passion project!</span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>21 days left until PAX East! As the days fly by, the whole team is hard at work getting The Great Gaias ready for Boston. Everyone is hard at work, from polishing off the demo to putting finishing touches on our upcoming feature-length trailer. The Great Gaias is more than just a video game: it is a tale of friendship, betrayal, and destiny. An epic adventure requires an epic soundtrack, and it would not be what it is today without our composer, Bryan Davis. Creating an emotional landscape with music <span class="fold">is Bryan’s passion, and his work will accompany you throughout much of the game. Remember to keep an eye out for our upcoming trailer, and we look forward to seeing you all at PAX East!</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>After many months, our crafting system is finally finished and fully implemented into the game! Dispatching enemies will yield skins and various useful materials. Veins of ore lay buried deep within subterranean caverns found throughout the vast mountainous regions of Tenat. When these items are used in conjunction it is possible to craft superior armor and weapons. Recently, because the main story is nearing completion, we've taken a step back and dug into fixing many issues that have been around <span class="fold">for a while; specifically formally persistent bugs, graphic modifications, and tweaks to the battle system to help balance it further. Now, with those out of the way, we are beginning a closed distribution of select alpha versions of the game with the intent to help us find and fix any remaining bugs. This is a tremendous step forward, as we continue the development process of The Great Gaias. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We are proud to announce the completion of the <i>Build Your Own City</i> sidequest! As a player you will be able to find inhabitants for a newly established city. As mayor of the city, you decide what kind of citizens will live there, and what kind of city it will become. Merchants, crafters, witty denizens, all over the world you may discover potential citizens for your city who seek to find a new home. Outcomes differ depending on how you populate your new city. For example, if you allow in too many <span class="fold">brigands, you may find your city has become a rundown slum, or that a casino has sprung up. However, if merchants and craftsman populate your city it may become a bustling center of trade, and you might find rare items trickling in from the far corners of the world. Or perhaps you prefer a little political intrigue in the vein of Game of Thrones? Recruit enough nobles and politicians and before long you may find yourself thrust into a nest of vipers as a Machiavellian battle for political dominance unfolds. There are many possibilities, each with its own rewards, but one thing is certain, you will have to try many combinations to receive all of the benefits that this sidequest has to offer! </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>It's been a long time since our last public update, however we've been steadily chugging along here at Horizon's End and making spectacular gains in the development of our old school RPG game <strong>The Great Gaias</strong>. We've finally completely woven our biography system into the game. Our painstaking efforts to detail the background stories of every character of significance has paid off in the form of this feature which has come to be our pride and joy. Each character's biography is cataloged and <span class="fold">updated after discovering new information about what roles they play throughout the story. Also, recently we hired two new artists who have brought their unique and wonderful styles to our project. Elisa Herrera, also known as <i>Sukihi</i>, has taken over as our portrait artist, and Madalin Vlad is currently developing our custom user interface. Please check our <a href="#artists">links</a> to samples of their incredible work! </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Another incredibly productive month has past as we move forward toward the release of The Great Gaias! Bryan Davis has created a score of magnificent music which complements the theme of our story so well, it gives you goosebumps. Piotr, as always has been steadily creating more amazing custom artwork; buildings, weapons, monsters, his talent and style has transformed The Great Gaias so dramatically and beautifully that it cannot be overstated. Since we are nearing the completion <span class="fold">of the main story, we've begun to put more focus on side content. From optional mini-games to in-depth side stories that flesh out each of our sixteen playable characters, we want our side quests to be just as rich and story driven as the main quest, and just as rewarding as well. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We have some great news this month! We've got our new battle animations, created by the talented artist, Charlie Everton! These amazing spell and attack animations truly make the action packed battles of The Great Gaias come to life! As per usual, we've been plugging away at the main story, keeping a steady pace, and getting closer and closer to the finish line. Right now we are finishing up our work on the <i>Great Desert of Tenat</i>. A harsh landscape devoid of life, but for a mysterious and enormous tree ever <span class="fold">present upon the edge of the horizon. How could anything survive in such a desolate environment? Tales of ancient heroes, who've ventured to explore the great tree, those who experienced visions of prophesy, are detailed in the annals of the Grand Arcanum. Will you follow in the footsteps of those great heroes of old, and unlock the mysteries of the past? </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Wow, it's been three months already since my last update on The Great Gaias! Having so focused on development I lost track of time. The main storyline has been moving full speed ahead, only three more areas left until the game will be playable from beginning to end! After that we will just need to focus on side quests and fluff, speaking of which, we also buttoned up a major end game side plot and completely integrated all legendary relics (armor and weapons) for the sixteen playable characters. On <span class="fold">the art side of things, Piotr has been pumping out monsters and character animations every week and Luluseason is nearing completion of all the remaining character portraits in the game. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This past month has been very exciting, so much has been done, and finally a real release date is beginning to come into view! Finally, after more than six months, we have completed our conversion to the new engine. With that out of the way we were able to focus our attention back on core development and adding new content. This new content includes such things as an elaborate crafting system with mined ore, harvest plants, and monster parts for crafting weapons, armor, and accessories. New <span class="fold">original artwork has been added including buildings, monsters, and sprites. Dialogue rewrites have been moving forward, tightening up the story and breathing life into our many playable characters. Back in October I mentioned the Minotaur city of Xellos. We've finally gone back and put the finishing touches on that part of the main story and moved on to the Kizul Jungle, home to a lost civilization, located on the Old Continent. We really can't express how happy we are to be back to working on the main story and steadily moving toward the release of The Great Gaias. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

The updated demo of The Great Gaias will be ready once this conversion is finished, and it will be available for download on our website for PC, Mac/iOS and Android. Also, while the conversion process has been going on, we have been updating and polishing the in-game dialogue, as well as related text editing.</p>

            <p>2015 is coming to a close and it has been a big year for Horizon's End. Development on The Great Gaias has come a long way this year. The artwork, storyline, side quests, and more have all undergone major changes, and have seen massive progression. Most recently and importantly, we have converted The Great Gaias to its new engine, a process that is still in the works, but nearing completion. We are very excited to announce we have a new artist working with us, his name is Piotr Radecki and <span class="fold">his pixel art is truly amazing. The buildings shown in this picture are part of his work.

Along with the engine update we have also broken down our combat system and rebuilt it to be bigger and better than ever. I'll give more information <span class="fold">on the new combat system at a later date but we are really proud of it, so stay tuned. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This past month we've been plowing through development of Osiris at an incredible pace. Expanding on the Minotaur culture, we have created their holy city of Xellos which lies at the base of the Mountain, Gar Ja'lal. With the completion of Osiris a week or two away, plans for Frosthammer, the Dwarven capital are underway. Initial work on the Frosthammer storyboard is planned for this coming week and I'll try to make another update on the lore behind the city, like I've done for other locations in <span class="fold">the past. Last but not least, two more playable characters out of our eighteen have been fully implemented into the battle system! </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

A proud and ancient race, the Minotaur remain untouched by the gods, and reverent to the earth.

Although the Minotaur have been drawn south before, their tribes have called the Gorgath Mountains home since the time of the Erda, and prefer its isolation to the politics <span class="fold">and disputes of the southern races. A Minotaur's admiration for strength and loyalty is renowned, as is their belief in the Ways of the North, which decree that might makes right, and only the strongest of warriors earns the right to be Chieftain. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

After Ramse Bavador seized the Stone Throne of Amanor during the Amanian Rebellion, he has twisted the minds of its people, and now rules absolutely as their so-called 'savior'. Living in voluntary isolation after the coup that deposed the Faelyn royal family, the citizens of Amanor have succumb to the will of a crazed tyrant bent on not only ruling the country, but the entire human civilization.</p>
