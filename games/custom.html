            <p>Much progress has been made over the past year on the development of Gjallarhorn! What's left now is to implement further aspects of the story and continued work on map design. All major systems are basically complete. Including weapon skill growth for each of the 15 weapon types; each weapon has its own skill tree with traits that can be unlocked at certain thresholds. Fame and Karma system which span the whole empire, plus individual town reputations for each of the 5 towns. As a result, NPCs and shops will react differently <span class="fold">based on these variables. The bounty board system, which lets the player work as a bounty hunter with many choice and consequence decisions. A day and night cycle with NPC schedules making the game world feel more realistic and alive. Thief quests which allow you to break into homes and shops at night if your thieving skills are high enough. Work on Gjallarhorn is progressing rapidly and on schedule for expected release next year. In the meantime if you haven't already done so, check out our current title, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/818610/The_Great_Gaias/" target="_blank" title="The Great Gaias on Steam">The Great Gaias</a> available on Steam.</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Horizon's End is offering The Great Gaias for the lowest price ever in hopes to promote social distancing! What better way to spend your time alone than with a (100+) hour old school JRPG? Not only have we lowered our price, but we have also crafted some new features including difficulty levels and a reworking of Chapter I. We have spent the last few weeks on The Great Gaias to address a few issues that have been on our plate for a while, many of which were based on the feedback we've received from the community. We have taken the <span class="fold">constructive criticism from our fan base into account and we hope that the new difficulty system and our AI balancing will help bring in new players to enjoy this epic tale! We haven't said much about Gjallarhorn, but rest assured, all the art and music has already been completed and we are in full production mode. It's moving along nicely, and we can't wait to show you what we have been working on! With the current situation, Horizon's End, would like to wish everyone good health and safety while we combat this global crisis. We hope that life will return to normal soon, as we were hoping to have our demo ready for PAX West, but in the meantime, please be safe, play The Great Gaias, enjoy the story... and remember, where the horizon ends, the journey begins!</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

Gjallarhorn will incorporate new features such as a taming mechanic, (16) job classes, monster abilities, rune crafting and much, much more.

            <p>Horizon's End is proud to announce the next installment in the ever expanding world that birthed The Great Gaias, <i>Codex Eternal</i>. The next chapter of this epic is called <strong>Gjallarhorn</strong>, and it aims to create a completely subjective experience for the player, allowing for the choice of joining one of multiple factions, or fighting for yourself in this slave-to-champion turn based role-playing game. Originally created as a Dungeons and Dragons Campaign Setting, this epic tale will continue the dark, yet engrossing stories within The Great Gaias. Gjallarhorn <span class="fold">will expand on job class mechanics and a sandbox style crafting system that will provide a near infinite amount of customization between gear, class, abilities and allies. Trapped in the frigid lands of the Gorgath Mountains, you will create your own ill-fated character, destined to become a slave to the Osirian Empire. As you take on job classes and earn fervor with the slave master, an opportunity for freedom arises when the Gladiator Arena is reopened during an ancient rite of choosing a new High Chieftain. Five factions forming the Osirian Empire seek to see their Champion as the High Chieftain. Their unique views on the direction of the Empire leaves the fragile relationship of a newly unified nation in the hands of the player as the choices and allies you make will rock the very foundations of the leaderless country. Create your own custom character as you fight for your freedom, unlocking (16) job classes to learn and master as you build your hero to fit your personal playstyle. Craft customizable gear for (16) equipment slots with endless options and augments including gems, runestones, and monster abilities. A day and night cycle sets the tone for the expansive hunting and gathering systems in place within Gjallarhorn. It will be up to the player to fill their bestiary with valuable knowledge pertaining to fishing, poaching and monster habits in hopes to find all the best, and rarest, crafting components. The combinations are limitless when it comes to party composition as you find animal companions to tame and interesting mercenaries each with their own stories and goals for you to help (or hinder). With so many complex decisions and event changing choices, it is impossible to see everything the first (or third) time around as you choose which faction you wish to side with (or none at all). We will be announcing a crowd-based funding for additional features via Kickstarter, (Likely in November), to help bring more art, music and mechanics to the table. However, fear not, regardless of getting Kickstarter funding, this game will aim to be released in quarter one of 2020. We are eager to bring the next great story to you, and remember, where the horizon ends, the journey begins!</span> <a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>After many months, our crafting system is finally finished and fully implemented into the game! Dispatching enemies will yield skins and various useful materials. Veins of ore lay buried deep within subterranean caverns found throughout the vast mountainous regions of Tenat. When these items are used in conjunction it is possible to craft superior armor and weapons. Recently, because the main story is nearing completion, we've taken a step back and dug into fixing many issues that have been around <span class="fold">for a while; specifically formally persistent bugs, graphic modifications, and tweaks to the battle system to help balance it further. Now, with those out of the way, we are beginning a closed distribution of select alpha versions of the game with the intent to help us find and fix any remaining bugs. This is a tremendous step forward, as we continue the development process of The Great Gaias. </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We are proud to announce the completion of the <i>Build Your Own City</i> sidequest! As a player you will be able to find inhabitants for a newly established city. As mayor of the city, you decide what kind of citizens will live there, and what kind of city it will become. Merchants, crafters, witty denizens, all over the world you may discover potential citizens for your city who seek to find a new home. Outcomes differ depending on how you populate your new city. For example, if you allow in too many <span class="fold">brigands, you may find your city has become a rundown slum, or that a casino has sprung up. However, if merchants and craftsman populate your city it may become a bustling center of trade, and you might find rare items trickling in from the far corners of the world. Or perhaps you prefer a little political intrigue in the vein of Game of Thrones? Recruit enough nobles and politicians and before long you may find yourself thrust into a nest of vipers as a Machiavellian battle for political dominance unfolds. There are many possibilities, each with its own rewards, but one thing is certain, you will have to try many combinations to receive all of the benefits that this sidequest has to offer! </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>

            <p>It's been a long time since our last public update, however we've been steadily chugging along here at Horizon's End and making spectacular gains in the development of our old school RPG game <strong>The Great Gaias</strong>. We've finally completely woven our biography system into the game. Our painstaking efforts to detail the background stories of every character of significance has paid off in the form of this feature which has come to be our pride and joy. Each character's biography is cataloged and <span class="fold">updated after discovering new information about what roles they play throughout the story. Also, recently we hired two new artists who have brought their unique and wonderful styles to our project. Elisa Herrera, also known as <i>Sukihi</i>, has taken over as our portrait artist, and Madalin Vlad is currently developing our custom user interface. Please check our <a href="#artists">links</a> to samples of their incredible work! </span><a class="toggle-fold">&hellip;More &raquo;</a></p>
